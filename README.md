# CS50: Artificial Intelligence with Python

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions, projects, and notes from the CS50: Artificial Intelligence with Python course 
offered by Harvard University. The course provides a solid foundation in AI, covering various topics such as search algorithms, optimization, machine learning, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. Through hands-on projects and assignments, students learn to apply AI principles to solve real-world problems.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Design and implement AI algorithms for different tasks
- Understand the theoretical underpinnings of AI techniques
- Apply machine learning models to analyze and interpret data
- Develop AI-based applications to solve complex problems

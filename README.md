# CS50: Artificial Intelligence with Python

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions, projects, and notes from the CS50: Artificial Intelligence with Python course 
offered by Harvard University. This course explores the concepts and applications of artificial intelligence, 
covering topics such as search algorithms, machine learning, optimization, and more.

## Course structure

The course is divided into several weeks, each focusing on different aspects of artificial intelligence. The key topics covered include:

### Search Algorithms: 
  * Uninformed and informed search strategies.
### Knowledge Representation: 
  * Propositional and first-order logic.
### Planning: 
  * Problem-solving through planning algorithms.
### Optimization: 
  * Constraint satisfaction problems and optimization techniques.
### Machine Learning: 
  * Supervised learning, regression, and classification.
###  Neural Networks: 
  * Fundamentals of neural networks and deep learning.
### Natural Language Processing: 
  * Techniques for processing and understanding human language.
### Ethics in AI: 
  * Ethical considerations and societal impacts of AI.
